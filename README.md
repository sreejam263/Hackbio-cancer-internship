# **Hackbio Cancer Internship**

## Description:
This `README.md` file contains details of different stages of the Internship.

## **`Stage 0`: Technical Writing**
+ ### Task Objective: 
  The objective of the stage-0 task was for the interns to develop essential technical writing skills, focusing on clear and concise communication of complex scientific concepts.
    - I chose Track 3, which was **"Data: ML and AI"** among the given options.
  
+ ### Task Description:
  To write an Essay (400 words) on one of the topics that were provided related to the chosen track. I wrote on the topic of **"RNA-Sequencing and its importance in Cancer Research"**.
    - For complete understanding, read `stage 0_RNA-Sequencing and its importance in Cancer Research.md` file.

  ## **`Stage 1`: Literature Review**
  + ### Task Objective: 
  The objective of the stage-1 task was to engage in a comprehensive literature review, critically analyzing existing research relevant to bioinformatics. Along with that we were also required to prepare a 3 minute long video explaining the review. This task was to be performed with a team of 4.
  + ### Task Description:
  To write a literature review (400 words) on one of the topics that were provided related to the chosen track. I wrote on the topic of **"Advances in Machine Learning for Lung Cancer: Enhancing Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prognosis"**.
    - For complete understanding, read `stage 1_ ML for Lung Cancer.md` file.
 
  ## **`Stage 2`: Programming in Biology & Data Visualization**
  + ### Task Objective: 
  The objective of the stage-2 task was to analyze biological data and create meaningful visualizations, using R. A **Glioblastoma (GBM)** was provided for the analysis.
  + ### Task Description:
  This task involves visualizing gene expression data of GBM using heatmaps, clustering analysis, and performing functional enrichment analysis to interpret biological significance. It includes generating color variants of heatmaps, clustering genes and samples, and creating pathway visualizations based on top enriched biological processes.
