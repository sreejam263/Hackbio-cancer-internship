## RNA-Sequencing and its importance in Cancer Research

RNA Sequencing is a high-throughput gene expression profiling method that has emerged as an attractive platform for analysing genome-wide changes in gene expression. Both qualitative and quantitative investigations can be carried out on data obtained from RNA-Seq experiments. The increasing use of NGS enables a more in-depth exploration of breast cancer's complex genetics, paving the way for personalized treatments (Wang et al., 2009)

Cancer is characterized by genetic mutations and aberrant gene expression, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and metastasis. Understanding these changes at the molecular level is essential for the development of targeted therapies and personalized medicine. RNA-Seq plays a crucial role in identifying these changes by providing a detailed snapshot of the transcriptomic landscape of cancer cells (Lang et al., 2023).

One of the significant advantages of RNA-Seq is its ability to detect both known and novel transcripts, including splice variants, fusion genes, and non-coding RNAs. This is particularly important in cancer, where alternative splicing and the expression of non-coding RNAs can drive tumorigenesis (Dorney et al., 2023). For instance, in breast cancer, RNA-Seq has been used to identify specific biomarkers or genes that are associated with resistance to endocrine therapy. This has led to the development of new therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting these resistant variants  (Jones CJ et al., 2021).

Moreover, RNA-Seq is instrumental in uncovering gene expression signatures that can serve as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response. The ability to compare gene expression profiles between cancerous and normal tissues or between different cancer subtypes allows for identifying key genes and pathways involved in cancer progression (Barrón-Gallardo et al., 2022). In addition to its applications in basic research, RNA-Seq is increasingly being used in clinical settings to guide treatment decisions (Byron et al., 2016). For example, the use of RNA-Seq in precision oncology allows for the identification of patient-specific mutations and gene expression patterns, enabling the selection of the most appropriate targeted therapies (Krzyszczyk et al., 2018).

In conclusion, RNA-Seq offers a deep understanding of the transcriptomic changes that drive cancer. Its ability to uncover novel transcripts, identify biomarkers, and guide personalized treatment makes it an indispensable tool in cancer treatment.
